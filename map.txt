what are important things to work on and better understand if i want to have a career in programming?
 
It depends on the area of programming. However a basic ground I think every developer should learn is data structures, algorithms, http Protocol, and a solid understanding of at least one programming language.
 
 
Data Structures:
- Array / List
- Hashmap / Object
- Linked List & double linked List
- Trees
- Graphs
 
Learn what they are, how to use them, what's their Algorithmic complexity.
 
 
Algorithms:
- few sorting Algorithms (Insertion Sort, Quicksort)
- search Algorithms (Breadth First Search, Depth First Search)
- Binary Search
 
Learn what they are, how to use them, what's their Algorithmic complexity.
 

Http:
- Sockets
- APIs
- Authentication / Authorization
 
Learn what they are, how to use them.
if your're doing front-end then learn about design, css, a framework like React or Vue, REST http end points or APIs.

if you're doing back-end there's much more to learn for example database, http framework, servers, Load balancing, proxy, micro services ...ect

you don't need to worry yourself with all this now, just pick one area and go deep, when you feel like you've learned enough switch to something else.
